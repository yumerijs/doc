# Installation

The simplest way to set up Yumeri is to use the official template. It’s quick and suited for first‑time users.

## Configure Mirror (Mainland China)

If you are in Mainland China, using local mirrors helps speed up npm/yarn installs.

NPM:

~~~bash
npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com
~~~

Yarn:

~~~bash
yarn config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com
~~~

## Create a Project

Open your terminal in the target folder and run:

Using npm:

~~~bash
npm init yumeri
~~~

Using yarn:

~~~bash
yarn create yumeri
~~~

## Start Yumeri

If dependencies were not installed automatically, install them and start:

Using npm:

~~~bash
npm start
~~~

Using yarn:

~~~bash
yarn start
~~~
